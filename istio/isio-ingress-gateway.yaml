# Create the Istio Gateway. Istio gateways let you use the full power and flexibility of Istioâ€™s traffic routing.
# Gateway allows you to manage inbound and outbound traffic for your mesh (aka application i.e. collection of services)
# REMEMBER: This will only grant access to the mesh. The actual routing to the service will be decided by the virtual services using this gateway
